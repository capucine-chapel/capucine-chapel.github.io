#      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am a Post-Doctoral Fellow in Economics at [CERDI](https://cerdi.uca.fr/#/) since October 2024.

I am on the 2025/2026 job market.

My research focuses on the analysis of sustainable development trajectories, with the aim of understanding the mechanisms, challenges and opportunities for steering societies towards a more sustainable future. My research falls within the fields of environmental, development and urban economics.

I have a strong interest in applied microeconometrics, spatial analysis and data processing.
